# face-tracking-xyaxis-bot
Using sample code from OpenCV, OpenCV/jSerialComm/javafx libraries, and an arduino controlling a x and y axis servo robot, i've created a face-following robot relative to your computer's main camera. Reference/source code at: https://github.com/opencv-java/face-detection
I DO NOT CLAIM ANY LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE ORIGINAL CODE USED BY OPENCV, REFERENCED OPENCV LIBRARIES OR ANY OF THE OTHER REFERENCED LIBRARIES
